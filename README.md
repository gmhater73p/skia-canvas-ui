# skia-canvas-ui

(from 2022)

This is [canvas-ui](https://github.com/gmhater73p/canvas-ui) rewritten to use [Skia (CanvasKit)](https://skia.org/docs/user/modules/canvaskit/) instead of the Web Canvas API alone.

See canvas-ui readme.

**Why Skia is better:**
* More performant because C Skia is compiled to WebAssembly
* Easier to implement fancy GUI effects such as blur
